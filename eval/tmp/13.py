    """
    If the final average score is greater than 80 and one or more papers are published, a scholarship of 8000 will be added
    If the final average score is greater than 85 points and the class evaluation is greater than 80 points, the scholarship will be increased by 4000 points
    If the final average score is greater than 90 points, the scholarship will be increased by 2000
    If the final average score is greater than 85 and the student is from the western region, the scholarship will be increased by 1000
    If the final assessment of the class is greater than 80 points and the class leader is the class leader, the scholarship will be increased by 850 points

    Parameters:
    grades (list of int): A two-element list containing the student's academic grades [end of term average, class evaluation].
    leader (str): A string ('Y' or 'N') indicating if the student is a class leader.
    west (str): A string ('Y' or 'N') indicating if the student is from a western province.
    papers (int): An integer representing the number of research papers published by the student.

    Returns:
    int: The total scholarship amount the student is eligible for.

    Examples:
    >>> calculate_scholarship([87, 82], 'Y', 'N', 0)
    4850

    >>> calculate_scholarship([88, 78], 'N', 'Y', 1)
