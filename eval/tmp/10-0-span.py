def sum_of_factorials_optimized(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Compute the cumulative sum of factorial values from 1 up to a specified integer n.

    This function employs a more efficient method to calculate factorials by iteratively
    multiplying the current number to the previous factorial result, thus avoiding redundant
    calculations. It then accumulates the factorial of each number from 1 to n inclusively.

    Args:
    n (int): The upper limit of the range for which the factorial sum is to be calculated.
             The value of n should be in the range of 1 to 50, inclusive.

    Returns:
    int: The sum of all factorial values from 1! to n!.

    Examples:
    >>> sum_of_factorials_optimized(3)
    9
    >>> sum_of_factorials_optimized(5)
    153
    >>> sum_of_factorials_optimized(6)
    873
