def find_topmost_carpet(n, carpets, point) -> int:
    """
    Finds the topmost carpet covering a given point on the coordinate plane.

    Args:
    n (int): The total number of carpets.
    carpets (list of tuples): A list containing n tuples, each representing a carpet's information.
                              Each tuple contains four integers (a, b, g, k) where (a, b) is the
                              coordinates of the bottom-left corner of the carpet and (g, k) are
                              the lengths of the carpet along the x and y axis respectively.
    point (tuple): A tuple containing two integers (x, y), the coordinates of the point to check.

    Returns:
    int: The number of the topmost carpet covering the point (x, y), or -1 if no carpet covers it.

    Examples:
    >>> find_topmost_carpet(3, [(1, 0, 2, 3), (0, 2, 3, 3), (2, 1, 3, 3)], (2, 2))
    3
    >>> find_topmost_carpet(3, [(1, 0, 2, 3), (0, 2, 3, 3), (2, 1, 3, 3)], (4, 5))
