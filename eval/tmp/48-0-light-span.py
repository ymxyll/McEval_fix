def min_groups(w, n, prices):
    """
    Determines the minimum number of groups needed to distribute souvenirs with a constraint on the group's total price.
    
    The souvenirs are grouped in pairs such that the total price of each group does not exceed the limit `w`. 
    The function aims to minimize the number of groups created under this constraint.
    
    Args:
    w (int): The maximum allowed sum of prices for any group of souvenirs.
    n (int): The total number of souvenirs.
    prices (list): A list of integers representing the price of each souvenir.
    
    Returns:
    int: The minimum number of groups required to distribute all souvenirs.

    Examples:
    
    Case 1:
    A limit of 100 and 9 souvenirs with prices [90, 20, 20, 30, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90].
    The minimum number of groups is 6.
    >>> min_groups(100, 9, [90, 20, 20, 30, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90])
    6
    
    Case 2:
    A limit of 200 and 5 souvenirs with prices [80, 120, 60, 40, 100].
    The minimum number of groups is 3.
    >>> min_groups(200, 5, [80, 120, 60, 40, 100])
    3
    
    Case 3:
    A limit of 80 and 4 souvenirs with prices [30, 30, 20, 10].
    Since each pair's total price does not exceed the limit, the minimum number of groups is 2.
    >>> min_groups(80, 4, [30, 30, 20, 10])
    2
