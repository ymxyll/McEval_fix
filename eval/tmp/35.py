def count_apples_reachable(apple_heights: List[int], tao_reach: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the number of apples that Tao Tao can reach.

    Args:
    apple_heights (List[int]): The heights of apples from the ground (in centimeters).
    tao_reach (int): The maximum height Tao Tao can reach with her hand stretched upwards (in centimeters).

    Returns:
    int: The number of apples Tao Tao can reach with or without standing on a 30cm stool.

    This function iterates over the list of apple heights and counts how many of them are within Tao Tao's reach,
    considering an additional 30cm that the stool provides.

    Example cases:
       count_apples_reachable([100, 120, 130, 140, 150, 150, 140, 130, 120, 110], 120) -> returns 10
