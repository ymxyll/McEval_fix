def catalan_number(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the nth Catalan number.

    The function computes the nth Catalan number using dynamic programming. Catalan numbers are a sequence of natural 
    numbers that have many applications in combinatorial mathematics, including the counting of certain types of lattice paths, 
    the number of expressions containing n pairs of parentheses which are correctly matched, the number of different ways n+1 
    factors can be completely parenthesized, and more.

    Args:
    - n (int): The position in the Catalan number sequence to compute (must be non-negative).

    Returns:
    - int: The nth Catalan number.

    Cases:
    - For n=0, the function should return 1, since C(0) = 1.
      catalan_number(0) -> 1

    - For n=3, the function should return 5, since C(3) = 5.
      catalan_number(3) -> 5

    - For n=5, the function should return 42, since C(5) = 42.
      catalan_number(5) -> 42

    Note:
    The computation is based on the recursive formula:
    C(n) = C(0)C(n-1) + C(1)C(n-2) + ... + C(n-1)C(0)
    where C(0) is 1.
