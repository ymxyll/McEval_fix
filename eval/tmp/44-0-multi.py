def jinjin_savings_plan(budgets: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    Calculates the total amount of money Jinjin will have by the end of the year
    after following her savings plan with her mother. Each month, she can save
    multiples of 100 from her pocket money (300 per month) if she predicts having
    at least 100 units remaining after expenses. The saved money will gain 20%
    interest at the end of the year.

    Parameters:
    budgets (List[int]): A list of 12 integers representing Jinjin's monthly budget.

    Returns:
    int: The total amount of money Jinjin will have at the end of the year after interest.
         If Jinjin runs out of money in any given month, returns the negative value of
         that month (-X, where X is the month number).

    Examples:
    >>> jinjin_savings_plan([290, 230, 280, 200, 300, 170, 340, 50, 90, 80, 200, 60])
    -7  # Jinjin runs out of money in July (the 7th month)
