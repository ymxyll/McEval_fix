def count_coprime_pairs(x0: int, y0: int) -> int:
    """
    Counts the number of pairs of positive integers (P, Q) such that P and Q have x0 as their greatest common divisor (GCD)
    and y0 as their least common multiple (LCM).

    Args:
    x0 (int): The GCD that each pair (P, Q) must have.
    y0 (int): The LCM that each pair (P, Q) must have.

    Returns:
    int: The count of all possible pairs (P, Q) that meet the specified criteria.

    The function iterates through all possible factors 'a' of the quotient 'y0 / x0'. For each factor 'a',
    it calculates the corresponding factor 'b' such that 'a * b = y0 / x0'. It then checks if 'a' and 'b'
    are co-prime (their GCD is 1) because P and Q can only be multiples of 'x0' by co-prime factors to maintain
    the GCD as 'x0'. If 'a' and 'b' are co-prime, the count is incremented by 1 if 'a' is the same as 'b',
    else by 2 to account for both (P, Q) and (Q, P) pairs.

    Example Cases:

    >>> count_coprime_pairs(3, 60)
    4
    >>> count_coprime_pairs(2, 50)
    0
