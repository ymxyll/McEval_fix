In this case, the `else` statement is not used, so the function does not have an `else` clause.\n\nThe function uses the `==` operator to compare the `leader` and `west` parameters to the string 'Y', and the `>` operator to compare the `avg_grade` and `class_eval` parameters to the integer 80.\n\nThe function uses the `and` keyword to combine conditions. The `and` keyword is used to check if both conditions are true. If the first condition is false, the second condition is not checked.\n\nThe function uses the `>` operator to compare the `avg_grade` and `class_eval` parameters to the integer 80. The `>` operator is used to check if the first parameter is greater than the second parameter. If the first parameter is not greater than the second parameter, the function does not check the remaining conditions.\n\nThe function uses the `+=` operator to add the scholarship amounts to the `scholarship` variable. The `+=` operator is used to add the right-hand side of the operator to the left-hand side of the operator.\n\nThe function uses the `return` statement to return the total scholarship amount. The `return` statement is used to end the function and to specify the value that is returned by the function.\n\nThe function uses the `list` type hint to indicate that the `grades` parameter should be a list of integers. The `str` type hint is used for the `leader` and `west` parameters, indicating that they should be strings. The `int` type hint is used for the `papers` parameter, indicating that it should be an integer.\n\nThe function uses the `==` operator to compare the `leader` and `west` parameters to the string 'Y', and the `>` operator to compare the `avg_grade` and `class_eval` parameters to the integer 80.\n\nThe function uses the `and` keyword to combine conditions.

It then iterates through all possible factors of the quotient. For each factor, it calculates the corresponding factor and checks if the two factors are co-prime. If they are, the count is incremented by 1 if the two factors are the same, and by 2 if they are not. The function finally returns the count of all possible pairs (P, Q) that meet the specified criteria.\n\nThe function uses the `math.gcd` function to check if two numbers are co-prime. The `math.gcd` function returns the greatest common divisor of the two numbers. If the greatest common divisor is 1, the two numbers are co-prime.\n\nThe function also uses the `math.sqrt` function to limit the range of the for loop. The for loop only needs to iterate through all numbers up to the square root of the quotient, because the factors of the quotient are symmetric around the square root.\n\nThe function uses the floor division operator `//` to calculate the factor b. The floor division operator rounds the quotient of the two numbers down to the nearest whole number, which is the correct way to calculate the factor b.\n\nThe function uses the modulus operator `%` to check if the quotient is divisible by the current number. If the quotient is divisible by the current number, the current number is a factor of the quotient.\n\nThe function uses the `range` function to iterate through all possible factors of the quotient. The range function generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to the square root of the quotient.\n\nThe function uses the `int` function to convert the square root of the quotient to an integer, because the range function requires an integer argument.\n\nThe function uses the `+` operator to increment the count of coprime pairs. The `+` operator adds the right operand to the left operand and returns the result.\n\nThe function uses the `if` statement to check if the two factors are co-prime and to increment the count of coprime pairs. The `if` statement checks if the condition in the parentheses is true. If the condition is true, the code in the block is executed.\n\nThe function uses the `else` keyword to specify a block of code to be executed if the previous `if` statement was false.\n\nThe function uses the `return` statement to end the function and to give the result back to the caller. The `return` statement can return a value to the caller. If the function does not return a value, it returns `None` by default.\n\nThe function uses the `def` keyword to define a new function. The `def` keyword is followed by the name of the function and the parameters in parentheses. The code block that follows the `def` keyword is the body of the function.\n\nThe function uses the `import` statement to import the `math` module. The `math` module provides mathematical functions and constants.\n\nThe function uses the `//` operator to perform floor division. The `//` operator divides the left operand by the right operand and returns the largest whole number less than or equal to the exact result.\n\nThe function uses the `%` operator to perform modulus division. The `%` operator divides the left operand by the right operand and returns the remainder of the division.\n\nThe function uses the `range` function to generate a sequence of numbers. The `range` function takes three arguments: the start, the stop, and the step. The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from the start, up to but not including the stop, in steps of the step.\n\nThe function uses the `int` function to convert a number or a string to an integer.

The function returns the total number of trees remaining along the road after the specified areas have been cleared.\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of areas.

The cost of merging two heaps is the sum of their weights, so we will keep adding the cost to the total cost.\n\nHere is the Python function that implements this approach:\n\n```python\nimport heapq\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef minimum_cost_to_merge_fruits(fruit_counts: List[int]) -> int:\n    # Convert the list to a min-heap\n    heapq.heapify(fruit_counts)\n    \n    total_cost = 0\n    \n    # While there is more than one heap left\n    while len(fruit_counts) > 1:\n        # Pop the two smallest heaps\n        heap1 = heapq.heappop(fruit_counts)\n        heap2 = heapq.heappop(fruit_counts)\n        \n        # Calculate the cost of merging these two heaps\n        cost = heap1 + heap2\n        \n        # Add the cost to the total cost\n        total_cost += cost\n        \n        # Push the merged heap back into the heap\n        heapq.heappush(fruit_counts, cost)\n    \n    # Return the total cost\n    return total_cost\n```\n\nLet's test the function with the provided examples:\n\n```python\nprint(minimum_cost_to_merge_fruits([1, 2, 9]))  # Should print 15\nprint(minimum_cost_to_merge_fruits([10, 20, 30, 40, 50]))  # Should print 300\n```\n\nThis function should work correctly and efficiently for the given problem. It uses the built-in `heapq` module in Python, which provides an implementation of the heap queue algorithm, also known as the priority queue algorithm.\n"]}

Then, it enters a loop that continues as long as there are enough butts to exchange for a new cigarette. In each iteration of the loop, it calculates the number of new cigarettes that can be smoked by exchanging the current number of butts, adds this to the total number of cigarettes, and updates the current number of butts to the remaining butts plus the new cigarettes. The loop ends when there are not enough butts to exchange for a new cigarette. The function then returns the total number of cigarettes smoked.\n\nHere are some test cases:\n\n```python\nprint(total_smoked_cigarettes(4, 3))  # Output: 5\nprint(total_smoked_cigarettes(10, 3))  # Output: 14\n```\n\nThese test cases match the expected outputs in the problem statement.\n"]}
