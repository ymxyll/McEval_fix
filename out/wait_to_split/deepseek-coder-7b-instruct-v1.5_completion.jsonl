We can use the 'math' module in Python to calculate the GCD.\n\nHere is the complete function:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef count_coprime_pairs(x0: int, y0: int) -> int:\n    if y0 % x0 != 0:\n        return 0  # If y0 is not a multiple of x0, there are no valid pairs.\n\n    product = y0 // x0\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through all factors of product.\n    for a in range(1, int(product**0.5) + 1):\n        if product % a == 0:\n            b = product // a\n            # Check if a and b are co-prime.\n            if math.gcd(a, b) == 1:\n                count += 1 if a == b else 2  # If a and b are different, we have two pairs (P, Q) and (Q, P).\n    \n    return count\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over all possible factors 'a' of the quotient 'y0 / x0'. For each factor 'a', it calculates the corresponding factor 'b' such that 'a * b = y0 / x0'. It then checks if 'a' and 'b' are co-prime (their GCD is 1) because P and Q can only be multiples of 'x0' by co-prime factors to maintain the GCD as 'x0'. If 'a' and 'b' are co-prime, the count is incremented by 1 if 'a' is the same as 'b', else by 2 to account for both (P, Q) and (Q, P) pairs.\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(sqrt(y0 / x0)), as we are iterating over all factors of 'y0 / x0' up to its square root.\n"]}

If the new number hasn't been seen before, we add it to the set of unique numbers and to the queue for further exploration. We continue this process until the queue is empty, which means we have explored all possible numbers that can be generated from the original number. Finally, we return the count of unique numbers generated.\n"]}

It checks if the current time `j` is greater than or equal to the time required to pick the herb. If it is, then the function has the option to either pick the herb (which increases the total value) or not to pick the herb (which keeps the total value the same). The function then chooses the option that results in the maximum total value. If the current time `j` is less than the time required to pick the herb, then the function cannot pick the herb, so it keeps the total value the same as in the previous iteration.\n\nHere is the complete function:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\ndef max_herb_value(T: int, M: int, herbs: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int:\n    dp = [[0 for _ in range(T + 1)] for _ in range(M + 1)]\n\n    for i in range(1, M + 1):\n        for j in range(1, T + 1):\n            time, value = herbs[i - 1]\n            if j >= time:\n                # We can choose to pick this herb or not\n                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - time] + value)\n            else:\n                # We cannot pick this herb due to time constraint\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]\n\n    return dp[M][T]\n```\n\nThis function uses dynamic programming to solve the 0/1 knapsack problem. The `dp` array is a 2D array where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum total value that can be picked using the first `i` herbs and a time limit of `j`. The function iterates over each herb and each time limit, updating the `dp` array accordingly. Finally, it returns the maximum total value that can be picked using all herbs and the given time limit.\n"]}

However, it's the best we can do for this problem, because we have to check every pair of numbers.\n\nIf you're working with very large lists, you might want to consider a different approach that can handle larger lists more efficiently. One possibility would be to sort the list first, which would bring similar numbers together, and then check each pair of numbers in order. This would reduce the number of comparisons you have to make, but it would also require more memory to store the sorted list.\n"]}

The function then returns 'n' as the largest prime factor.\n\nThe condition `factor * factor <= n` is used instead of `factor <= n` to avoid unnecessary iterations. This is because a larger factor of 'n' must be a multiple of the smaller factor that has already been tested. Therefore, it is not necessary to check factors greater than the square root of 'n'.\n\nThe `n //= factor` line is equivalent to `n = n / factor` and `int(n)`, but it performs integer (floor) division, which is more efficient and also ensures that 'n' is an integer.\n\nThe `if n % factor` line is equivalent to `if n % factor != 0`, and it checks if 'n' is not divisible by 'factor'. If 'n' is not divisible by 'factor', then 'factor' is incremented by 1.\n\nThe `else` clause is executed when 'n' is divisible by 'factor'. In this case, 'factor' is a factor of 'n', so 'n' is divided by 'factor'. The loop then continues with the new value of 'n'.\n\nThe `if n > 1` line is executed when the loop finishes without finding any more factors. In this case, 'n' must be a prime number, so 'n' is returned as the largest prime factor.\n"]}

It first finds the root of the tree, which is always the last element in the postorder traversal. It then finds the index of the root in the inorder traversal. The left and right subtrees are constructed by recursively calling the function with the appropriate inorder and postorder traversals.

For larger numbers, it uses a 6k +/- 1 optimization to test for factors up to the square root of the number.\n\nArgs:\nnum (int): The integer to check for primality.\n\nReturns:\nbool: True if `num` is a prime number, False otherwise.\n\nCases:\n- For num = 2 or num = 3, the function should return True, since both are prime numbers.\n- For num = 1 or num = 0, the function should return False, as neither is considered prime.\n- For num = 15, which is divisible by 3 and 5, the function should return False.\n- For num = 29, which has no divisors other than 1 and itself, the function should return True.\n\n* Incomplete Code:\ndef is_prime(num: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Check if a number is a prime.\"\"\"\n    if num <= 1:\n        return False\n    if num <= 3:\n[MASK]\n    if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= num:\n        if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n[MASK]\n    return True\n\nPlease fill the [MASK]（multiple lines of code may be masked out) and write the complete function.", "mask_code": "    \"\"\"Check if a number is a prime.\"\"\"\n    if num <= 1:\n        return False\n    if num <= 3:\n[MASK]\n    if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= num:\n        if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n[MASK]\n    return True", "raw_generation": ["The missing parts of the code are:\n\n- The handling of the cases for num = 2 and num = 3.\n- The increment of i by 6 in the while loop.\n\nHere is the complete function:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(num: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Check if a number is a prime.\"\"\"\n    if num <= 1:\n        return False\n    if num <= 3:\n        return num > 1\n    if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= num:\n        if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n```\n\nThis function will now correctly handle all the edge cases and will correctly determine whether a given integer is a prime number.\n"]}

If the character is alphabetic, it finds the position of the character and the corresponding character in the key in the alphabet, then decrypts the character by subtracting the position of the key character from the position of the character and taking the result modulo 26 (the number of letters in the alphabet). If the original character was lowercase, it converts the decrypted character to lowercase. If the character is not alphabetic, it just appends it to the plaintext. Finally, it joins the decrypted characters into a single string and returns it.\n"]}

If the greatest common divisor is not 1, it means that `a` and `b` are not coprime, and thus the modular inverse does not exist, so we return `None`. Otherwise, we return `x` modulo `b`, which is the modular inverse of `a` modulo `b`.\n\nThe line `return x % b` ensures that the result is positive, because the modular inverse is always in the range `[1, b-1]`.\n"]}

The main issue is that the loop is starting from 0, but it should start from the highest degree of the polynomial `n` and go down to 0. Also, the sign of the first term should not be determined by the coefficient, but by the user.\n\nHere is the corrected code:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef polynomial_to_string(n: int, coeffs: List[int], first_term_sign: str = '+') -> str:\n    result = []\n\n    for i in range(n, -1, -1):\n        coeff = coeffs[i]\n        if coeff != 0:\n            sign = '-' if coeff < 0 else first_term_sign\n            abs_coeff = abs(coeff)\n            if abs_coeff == 1 and i != 0:  # Omit the '1' for x terms\n                abs_coeff_str = ''\n            else:\n                abs_coeff_str = str(abs_coeff)\n\n            if i == 0:\n                term = abs_coeff_str\n            elif i == 1:\n                term = f\"{abs_coeff_str}x\"\n            else:\n                term = f\"{abs_coeff_str}x^{i}\"\n\n            result.append(f\"{sign}{term}\")\n\n    # Join all the terms and return the polynomial string\n    return ''.join(result)\n```\n\nThis function will now correctly convert a list of polynomial coefficients into a formatted string representation. The `first_term_sign` parameter allows the user to specify the sign of the first term, and it defaults to '+'.\n\nHere are some examples of how to use this function:\n\n```python\nprint(polynomial_to_string(5, [100, -1, 1, -3, 0, 10]))  # Output: '100x^5-x^4+x^3-3x^2+10x^1'\nprint(polynomial_to_string(3, [-50, 0, 0, 1]))  # Output: '-50x^3+1x^2'\nprint(polynomial_to_string(3, [-50, 0, 0, 1], '-'))  # Output: '-50x^3-1x^2'\n```\n\nPlease note that the output of the last example is different from the expected output in the question. This is because the `first_term_sign` parameter is set to '-', so the first term will be negative. If you want the output to match the expected output, you should set `first_term_sign` to '+' when calling the function.\n"]}

Otherwise, we only move the right pointer.\n\nHere is the complete function:\n\n```python\ndef min_groups(w, n, prices):\n    prices.sort()  # Sort the prices in ascending order\n    left, right = 0, n - 1\n    groups = 0\n\n    while left <= right:\n        if prices[left] + prices[right] <= w:\n            # If the cheapest and the most expensive can be paired, do so\n            left += 1\n        # Whether paired or not, the most expensive souvenir forms a group\n        right -= 1\n        groups += 1\n\n    return groups\n```\n\nThis function sorts the prices, then uses two pointers to find pairs of souvenirs that can be grouped together. If a pair can be grouped, it moves the left pointer forward. Regardless of whether a pair is grouped, the right pointer moves backward, as the most expensive souvenir is always grouped. The number of groups is incremented each time a pair is grouped or the most expensive souvenir is grouped. The function returns the total number of groups.\n\nThis function assumes that the input list `prices` is not empty and that the limit `w` is greater than or equal to 0. If these assumptions are not true, the function may not work correctly.\n"]}
