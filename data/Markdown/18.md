GitLens adds Git authorship CodeLens to the top of the file and on code blocks. The **recent change** CodeLens shows the author and date of the most recent commit for the code block or file, while the **authors** CodeLens shows the number of authors of the code block or file and the most prominent author (if there is more than one).
